## What is 'Otaku Time'
Otaku time is a project started long ago because the website I watch anime from was awful, since it was unreliable and full of advertisements. It was also a lot of effort to download videos, and thus Otaku Time was born to combat this problem.

## License
Otaku Time is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/JackRyder/Otaku-Time/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Is this allowed?
I dunno, probably not.

## How does it work?
Otaku Time works by scraping HTML pages and running JavaScript in order to get the intended result for the user.

## Is it perfect?
Nope. There will be problems that you may come across, but luckily for you PR's are welcome and submitting issues is also encouraged, if I don't know about bugs I cannot fix them.

## Thanks, I guess?
No problem, if you like what i've done please star so I know how many people are interested in this product :)
